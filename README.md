# Copy Improved

'cuz the default copy is kinda annoying.

Replaces the default Copy/Cut commands

* when no text is selected
  * Doesn't copy anything
  * (TODO: add option) copy's the current word

* when multiple selections are copied
  * pastes properly into multiple selections, like sublime text

* TODO: preserve folds

* TODO: roll into PRs for core atom
